GitAutoRefresh

What it does?
With this service you will can have all the branches from all the repositories from a path up-to-date automatically. Is very useful if you work with lots of projects and want to have them all up-to-date locally in a PC.

How it works?
This service will scan a path searching for .gitignore files. If it finds the file, it will make a pull to all the found branches.
