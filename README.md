GitAutoRefresh

What it does?

With this service you will can have all the branches from all the repositories from a path up-to-date automatically. Is very useful if you work with lots of projects and want to have them all up-to-date locally in a PC.

How to use it?

Just open the service with a IDE, set the mainPath variable to the path you want to scan and run the program.

How it works?

This service will scan a path searching for .gitignore files. If it finds the file, it will make a pull to all the found branches.

Future improvements:
1- Set the path as an argument
2- Make a python script 
3- Error management
